# Multi-Day Continuity Implementation

## Quick Start

### Test the System

```bash
# Full integration test (3 consecutive days)
node test-continuity.js

# Visual verification (after test completes)
node verify-visual-continuity.js 2025-10-01 2025-10-02

# Manual generation for tomorrow
node generate-next-day.js
```

### Production Use

```bash
# Generate tomorrow's landscape
node generate-next-day.js

# The scheduler will automatically run at 5 PM daily
# First day: uses default seed
# Day 2+: seamlessly continues from previous day
```

## What Was Implemented

âœ… **Continuity Files** - Each day saves:
- `{date}_final_seed.png` - Last 512px of panorama â†’ next day's input
- `{date}_final_description.txt` - Final prompt â†’ next day's starting description

âœ… **Smart Loading** - Generation checks for previous day's outputs:
- Found: Uses them for seamless continuity
- Not found: Falls back to defaults

âœ… **Optimal Scheduling** - Moved from midnight â†’ 5 PM:
- Generates tomorrow 7 hours before midnight
- Frontend preloads at 5 PM (perfect timing)
- Completes by ~5:17 PM

âœ… **Pixel-Perfect Transitions** - 256px overlap at midnight:
- Day N ends with pixels [..., 6656]
- Day N+1 starts with pixels [256-512] from Day N
- Smooth visual flow at transition

## How It Works

```
Day 1 (5 AM) â†’ saves final 512px + description
       â†“
Day 2 (6 AM) â†’ loads Day 1 outputs â†’ seamlessly extends
       â†“
Day 3 (6 AM) â†’ loads Day 2 outputs â†’ seamlessly extends
       â†“
       âˆž
```

## Files Modified

- `server/services/promptGenerator.js` - Accepts custom initial description + date
- `server/services/stabilitySDInpaintingGenerator.js` - Saves & returns final outputs
- `test-full-day-generation.js` - Loads previous day's outputs
- `server/middleware/imageGeneration.js` - Scheduler at 5 PM with continuity

## New Files

- `generate-next-day.js` - Automated workflow script
- `test-continuity.js` - Full integration test (3 days)
- `verify-visual-continuity.js` - Visual comparison tool
- `MULTI_DAY_CONTINUITY.md` - Detailed documentation
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures

## Documentation

ðŸ“– **[MULTI_DAY_CONTINUITY.md](MULTI_DAY_CONTINUITY.md)** - Complete system documentation
ðŸ“‹ **[TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Testing procedures & verification

## Success Criteria

âœ… Day 2+ reports "CONTINUITY MODE"
âœ… Final seed = 512x512 PNG
âœ… Final description saved correctly
âœ… Visual transition seamless at midnight
âœ… Narrative flows across days
âœ… No quality degradation

## The Result

ðŸŒ„ **An infinite, seamless, evolving landscape that never ends!**

Each day at midnight, the view smoothly transitions from one day's 5 AM scene to the next day's 6 AM scene. The landscape grows indefinitely, naturally adapting to seasons while maintaining visual and narrative coherence.
